abstract: This technical report presents an ongoing research project at UW-Madison that employs a game-theoretic approach to analyze the behaviors of social media influencers in various game settings. The primary objective is to design a mechanism that incentivizes these influencers to provide unbiased reports to their audience. By modeling influencers and broadcasting companies as players in a general-sum game, the study aims to minimize biases in the content produced. The report delves into concepts such as Nash Equilibrium and best-response dynamics, illustrating how these can be applied to achieve a pure Nash Equilibrium in potential games. Empirical results are provided to demonstrate the effects of different parameters on playersâ€™ decisions. Additionally, the report explores a mechanism with punishment to deter cheating behaviors among influencers, ensuring more truthful reporting. The findings contribute to the broader understanding of strategic interactions in digital media and offer insights into promoting unbiased information dissemination.

Here we consider the most basic setting. There are n articles {{< math >}}$ x_{1}, \cdot, x_{n} ${{< /math >}} in a 2-dimensional space. There are two players, Big and Little, each having a target location, {{< math >}}$ B ${{< /math >}} and {{< math >}}$ L ${{< /math >}}, respectively. Each of them will choose a article from the set to incluence the victim. The victim learn by averarging their reports. Name the article chosen by Big {{< math >}}$ b $ {{< /math >}}, the article chosen by Little {{< math >}}$ l $ {{< /math >}}, and the victim's opinion {{< math >}}$ v $ {{< /math >}}. Then, {{< math >}}$$ v = \frac{b+l}{2} $${{< /math >}}.

      title: Influencer War
      text: Imagine there are two influencers in the cyberspace, who hold opposite perspectives about a certain event. They are trying to convince you to agree with their opinions by providing you with social media feeds simulatneously. In the simplest case, your opinion is formed by averaging these two posts you read. Then, how should these two influencers feed you posts?  
        
        In order to formulate the problem more easily, let's introduce some abstraction by considering the space of social media as a linear space, where each post is a vector. Then in our naive setting, your opinion is the the average of two vectors. These two influcers have their targets, which are two fixed vectors in the space. And they try to minimize the distance between your opinion and their targets, respectively.
